# Path Finder App

## Prerequisites

* Java JDK 11 - [https://adoptopenjdk.net/](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)
  * installed and set as `JAVA_HOME`

## <a name="build"></a>Build

Project is build using [Gradle Build Tool](https://gradle.org/). It's not required to have it installed on the system as the project
is shipped with [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html#header) which doesn't require Gradle to be installed.

### Bootable JAR

To create a bootable JAR which can be executed by JDK run the following:

* Linux:
  ```bash
  ./gradlew bootJar
  ```
  
* Windows
  ```bash
  ./gradlew.bat bootJar
  ```

This will generate a bootable JAR file in [./build/libs](./build/libs) directory, which can be used to run the project.
  
### Tests

To run tests, run the following:

* Linux:
  ```bash
  ./gradlew clean test
  ```

* Windows
  ```bash
  ./gradlew.bat clean test
  ```

The test results can be then viewed in the [HTML report](./build/reports/tests/test/index.html) generated by the build.

## Execution

There are multiple ways to start the application:
* using Gradle,
* executing bootable JAR file with `java`,
* from IDE.

In all above cases, application will run on the [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) once it is started. 

### Gradle

To start the application using Gradle run the following command:

* Linux:
  ```bash
  ./gradlew bootRun
  ```

* Windows
  ```bash
  ./gradlew.bat bootRun
  ```
  
### Execute bootable JAR file

To start the application by running the bootable JAR file with JDK 11, do the following:
* build the project, see [build](#build),
* run the following `java` command:
  ```bash
  java -jar ./build/libs/path-finder-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
  ```

### Using IDE 

Running the application from IDE is useful for testing new functionalities as well as debugging the application.

#### IntelliJ IDEA

To run the application from IntelliJ IDEA, do the following:
* one-time steps:
  * (once) import the project as Gradle project,
  * create a new _Spring Boot_ run configuration,
  * select `com.pwc.test.pathfinder.PathFinderApplication` as a main class,
  * save the configuration;
* run the created _Spring Boot_ run configuration.
